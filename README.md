# React app
This application is one of many laboratoty works on web-development lesson.

## Run
To start this site use command 'npm start' in your IDE (VS Code, for example).

## Troubles
If you can't start site because one of libraries can't find file (in my case it was "git.COM"), just use command 'npm run build' and then start project.
This will remove this problem.

## Work
Remember: you don't need to restart project, when you change code. 
Changes applies to code dynamically.
